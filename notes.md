#########IN THE FUTURE PLANNING ON ADDING:

-a few more sections:
  -camping/lodging
  -classifieds

-messages to user if wrong pw, email, etc.

-comments/social networking/likes
  -especially on markers so that more specific comments can be made (ie gas stops, campsite)

-connect markers with lines

-Info Window on markers

-Importing TrackFiles(xml files with lat longs) so that they can populate markers straight into the map




THANK REUBEN AND TA's


WHAT WOULD TELL YOURSELF
-get some sleep, even if you didnt accomplish anything that night, its better to take the loss so that you can have a chance at winning the next day




-the frustrating times when you cant figure out code for an hour or a day or two make the successful problems worth it. Just like life there are ups and downs and in coding they are extremely rewarding
